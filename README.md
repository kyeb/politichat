# Politichat

CS91r project in Spring 2020

Kye Burchard and Sabrina Chern

## Getting started

You'll need Node.js installed, and a `.env` file in the top level directory for the Mongo connection
string. Use `cp .env.example .env` and edit your .env file accordingly. Install the dependencies
with `npm install`.

Then, run `npm start` in one terminal, and `npm run hotloader` in another. You
should then be able to open the site in your browser at `localhost:5000`!
