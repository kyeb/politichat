# Politichat

CS91r project in Spring 2020

## Getting started

It should be as easy as running npm i, then npm start in one terminal and npm
run hotloader in another!

You'll need Node.js installed, and a .env file in the top level directory for the Mongo connection
string. Use `cp .env.example .env` and edit your .env file accordingly.
